# JD Vector - AI-Powered Job Description Analysis Platform

## 1. Problem Statement

**Business Challenge**

JD Vector addresses the critical need for automated, AI-powered job description analysis and intelligent interview question generation for talent acquisition and assessment scenarios. The platform streamlines content creation by extracting technical skills, generating relevant interview questions, and enabling real-time interaction across a scalable web-based interface with advanced similarity detection capabilities.

**Current Technical Stack**

- Frontend Interface: Implemented in Next.js 15.4.5 (React 19.1.0-based) with TypeScript and TailwindCSS
- AI Integration: Utilizes OpenAI GPT-4.1 for skill extraction and question generation, text-embedding-3-small for vector operations
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM (structured data with embedded JSON for vectors)
- Backend: Currently handled within Next.js API routes, with architecture supporting future FastAPI migration

## 2. Technical Approach

Build a comprehensive AI-powered platform that integrates advanced language models with vector similarity search and dynamic user interfaces. The current system leverages Next.js for both frontend and backend API routes, implementing sophisticated algorithms for skill matching, question generation, and similarity detection.

## 3. System Architecture

**High-Level Architecture**

```
Frontend (Next.js + React) â†’ API Routes (Next.js) â†’ OpenAI Services (GPT-4.1 + Embeddings) â†’ PostgreSQL (Prisma ORM)
                                    â†“
                            Vector Search Engine (Custom Similarity)
                                    â†“
                            Background Processing (Job Queue)
```

**Database Schema (Prisma)**

```sql
-- Core skill management with AI-generated aliases
Skill {id, name} â†’ SkillAlias {skillId, alias}

-- Question management with vector embeddings
Question {id, skillId, text, embedding}

-- Job description processing with similarity detection
JobDescription {id, title, content, embedding, status, createdAt}

-- Skills-to-JD relationships with confidence scoring
JobDescriptionSkill {jobDescriptionId, skillId, confidence, source}

-- Question-to-JD relationships with source attribution
SkillQuestion {jobDescriptionSkillId, questionId, source, confidence}

-- Analysis tracking with progress monitoring
JobDescriptionAnalysis {jobDescriptionId, source, message, similarJDs}
```

**API Architecture**

- `/api/skills/generate` - Individual skill question generation with hybrid approach
- `/api/jd/store` - Job description storage with embedding generation
- `/api/jd/analyze` - Streaming analysis with Server-Sent Events support
- `/api/jd/analyze/[id]` - Analysis results retrieval for stored job descriptions
- `/api/jd/process/[id]` - Background processing trigger with status tracking
- `/api/jd/status/[id]` - Real-time progress monitoring and completion status

## 4. Implementation Methodology

**Current Implementation (Next.js-based)**

- Integrated OpenAI API for skill extraction, question generation, and alias creation
- React-based UI with real-time progress indicators and collapsible analysis steps
- Next.js API routes handle data submission, LLM interactions, and background processing
- Custom vector similarity algorithms for intelligent content matching

**Core Algorithms & Intelligence**

_Skill Extraction & Matching_:

```typescript
// Multi-layer skill matching with AI-powered aliases
const skillMatching = {
  textSimilarity: await calculateTextSimilarity(extractedSkill, existingSkill),
  aiAliases: await getSkillAliases(skillName), // Dynamic alias generation
  semanticSimilarity: cosineSimilarity(skillEmbedding1, skillEmbedding2),
  confidenceScore: combinedSimilarity >= 0.8 ? "high" : "medium",
};
```

_Question Generation Strategy_:

```typescript
// Hybrid approach: 7 existing + 3 new pattern for optimal quality/cost
const questionStrategy = {
  existingQuestions: await getQuestionsBySkillId(skillId, 7),
  similarQuestions: await searchQuestionsBySkill(skillName, 3, 0.6),
  aiGenerated: similarity < 0.9 ? await generateNewQuestions(skill) : null,
};
```

_Similarity Detection_:

```typescript
// Job description similarity with 95% threshold for reuse
const jdSimilarity = {
  embedding: await getEmbedding(jobDescription),
  similarJDs: await searchSimilarJobDescriptions(content, 3, 0.9),
  reuseThreshold: similarity >= 0.95 && skillsMatch,
};
```
